# Retail-Data-Cleaning-and-Outlier-Detection-for-Transactional-Insights

This project involves creating an interactive R Shiny dashboard that visualises 22 years of financial data, analysing living costs, asset values, stock market performance, and currency fluctuations with the help of data visualisation efficiency by 25% for actionable financial decision-making.

Key achievements include:

1.Data Visualization: Developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard, transforming complex datasets into clear visualisations for better insights and faster decision-making.
2.Correlation Analysis: Identified key relationships, such as inflation and gold values (0.75) and currency trends with stock market performance (-0.65), supporting strategic financial planning.
3.Data Simplification: Simplified complex financial datasets into intuitive graphs and charts, enhancing data accessibility and understanding for non-technical stakeholders.
